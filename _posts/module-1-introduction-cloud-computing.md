## What Is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources** over the internet — instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical servers.

You rent:
- Servers (`EC2`, `VMs`)
- Storage (`S3`, `Blob`)
- Databases (`RDS`, `Cosmos DB`)
- AI, analytics, networking...

...and pay **only for what you use**.

> **Official AWS Definition** [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/cloud-computing.html):  
> _"The on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing."_

## The Evolution: From Physical → Virtual → Cloud

| Era | Technology | Problem Solved |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| 1960s | Mainframes | Shared computing |
| 2000s | **Virtualization** | Run multiple OS on one server |
| 2006 | **AWS EC2 Launch** | Rent virtual servers by the hour |
| Today | **Cloud-Native** | Auto-scaling, serverless, global |

**Key Insight**:  
> **Cloud = Virtualization + Internet + Pay-as-you-go**

## 🏠 Real-World Analogy: Rent vs Buy

| Buying a House | Renting an Apartment |
|----------------|------------------------|
| High upfront cost | Pay monthly |
| You maintain everything | Landlord handles repairs |
| Fixed space | Scale up/down easily |
| **On-Premises** | **Cloud** |

## 6 Advantages of Cloud (NIST Framework)

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cost Efficiency** | No CapEx. Pay-as-you-go. |
| **Scalability** | Scale to millions in seconds. |
| **Elasticity** | Auto-scale with demand. |
| **Global Reach** | Deploy in 30+ regions worldwide. |
| **Speed & Agility** | Launch in minutes, not months. |
| **Security** | Shared responsibility model. |

## Cloud Deployment Models

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Public Cloud** | Shared infrastructure (AWS, Azure) | Startups, web apps |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated to one org | Banks, government |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Mix of both | Legacy + cloud migration |

> **Hybrid is the new normal** — 89% of enterprises use it [](https://www.flexera.com)

## Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

| Model | You Manage | Provider Manages | Example |
|------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **IaaS** | OS, apps | Hardware, virtualization | AWS EC2 |
| **PaaS** | Apps | OS, runtime, scaling | AWS Elastic Beanstalk |
| **SaaS** | Nothing | Everything | Gmail, Salesforce |

> **AWS Service Mapping** [](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/):
> - **IaaS**: EC2, EBS, VPC
> - **PaaS**: Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
> - **SaaS**: Amazon Chime, WorkMail
