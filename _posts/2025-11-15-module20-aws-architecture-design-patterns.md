|------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **1. Operational Excellence** | Run and monitor systems to deliver business value | CloudWatch, Systems Manager, Lambda, CloudTrail | How do you understand system health? How do you manage operations as code? |
| **2. Security** | Protect data and systems | IAM, KMS, GuardDuty, Config, Security Hub | How do you manage credentials? How do you protect data in transit and at rest? |
| **3. Reliability** | Recover from disruptions and meet demand | Route 53, Auto Scaling, Multi-AZ, Backup, CloudFormation | How do you plan for failure? How do you scale to meet demand? |
| **4. Performance Efficiency** | Use computing resources efficiently | EC2 types, S3 tiers, CloudFront, Auto Scaling, Lambda | How do you select the right resource types? How do you monitor performance? |
| **5. Cost Optimization** | Deliver business value at lowest price | Cost Explorer, Budgets, Savings Plans, Spot Instances | How do you measure usage? How do you manage commitments? |

- **Establish sustainability goals** - Set targets for resource reduction
- **Maximize utilization** - Right-size workloads and automate scaling
- **Use managed services** - Leverage AWS scale and efficiency
- **Reduce downstream impact** - Optimize data transfer and algorithms

### **Sustainability Best Practices:**

**Compute Optimization:**
```yaml
- Use AWS Graviton processors (up to 60% better efficiency)
- Implement auto-scaling to match demand
- Use Spot Instances for flexible workloads
- Migrate to serverless (Lambda) where possible
```

**Storage Optimization:**
```yaml
- Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost and efficiency
- Implement data lifecycle policies
- Compress data before storage
- Delete unused resources regularly
```

**Data Transfer:**
```yaml
- Use CloudFront and edge locations to reduce data transfer
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize application protocols
- Use efficient data formats
```

## 🧩 Common AWS Architecture Patterns

### 1️⃣ Three-Tier Web Application Architecture

**Pattern:**
```
[CloudFront] → [ALB] → [Auto Scaling EC2 (Web)] → [Private EC2/Lambda (App)] → [RDS/DynamoDB (DB)]
```

**Key Services:**
* ALB for load balancing
* Auto Scaling for elasticity
* RDS/Aurora for database resilience
* S3/CloudFront for static content delivery
* CloudWatch + CloudTrail for monitoring

**Use Case:** Websites, eCommerce platforms, enterprise web apps.

---

### 2️⃣ Serverless Architecture

**Pattern:**
```
[API Gateway] → [Lambda Functions] → [DynamoDB / S3] → [EventBridge] → [Step Functions]
```

**Benefits:**
* Pay-per-use pricing
* No server management
* Auto-scaling natively handled
* Better sustainability (no idle resources)

**Use Case:** Microservices, chatbots, event-driven workflows.

---

### 3️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture

**Pattern:**
```
[Event Source] → [SNS / SQS / EventBridge] → [Lambda / Step Functions] → [Target Systems]
```

**Benefits:**
* Loose coupling between services
* Resilient to failures
* Easier scaling and auditing
* Efficient resource usage

**Use Case:** Order processing, IoT, notification systems.

---

### 4️⃣ Data Lake & Analytics Pattern

**Pattern:**
```
[Kinesis / DMS] → [S3 Data Lake] → [Glue ETL] → [Athena / Redshift] → [QuickSight]
```

**Benefits:**
* Scalable storage and analytics
* Pay-per-query model
* Serverless data processing
* Sustainable (no idle analytics infrastructure)

**Use Case:** Business intelligence, streaming analytics, data warehouse modernization.

---

### 5️⃣ Multi-Region Active-Active Architecture

**Pattern:**
```
Region A: [ALB + ASG + RDS]  ←→  Region B: [ALB + ASG + RDS]
               ↕ Route 53 Health Checks + Latency Routing ↕
```

**Benefits:**
* Zero downtime
* High fault tolerance
* Global performance optimization
* Disaster recovery compliance

**Use Case:** Mission-critical systems (banking, healthcare, trading).

## 🧠 Architectural Design Principles

| **Principle** | **Description** | **Well-Architected Pillar** |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Design for failure** | Assume components will fail; build redundancy | Reliability |
| **Decouple components** | Use queues and event-based designs | Reliability, Operational Excellence |
| **Automate everything** | Infrastructure as code (CloudFormation, CDK) | Operational Excellence |
| **Implement elasticity** | Auto Scale up/down with demand | Performance Efficiency, Sustainability |
| **Use managed services** | Offload undifferentiated heavy lifting | Cost Optimization, Sustainability |
| **Secure every layer** | IAM, encryption, WAF, network segmentation | Security |
| **Optimize for cost and performance** | Monitor usage and right-size resources | Cost Optimization, Performance Efficiency |
| **Minimize environmental impact** | Use efficient resources and maximize utilization | Sustainability |
